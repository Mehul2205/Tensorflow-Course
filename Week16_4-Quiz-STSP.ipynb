How do you add a 1 dimensional convolution to your model for predicting time series data?\n","\n","Ans. Use a Con1D layer type\n","\n","Q2. What’s the input shape for a univariate time series to a Conv1D? \n","\n","Ans. [None, 1]\n","\n","Q3. You used a sunspots dataset that was stored in CSV. What’s the name of the Python library used to read CSVs?\n","\n","Ans. CSV\n","\n","Q4. If your CSV file has a header that you don’t want to read into your dataset, what do you execute before iterating through the file using a ‘reader’ object?\n","\n","Ans. next(reader)\n","\n","Q5. When you read a row from a reader and want to cast column 2 to another data type, for example, a float, what’s the correct syntax?\n","\n","Ans. float(row[2])\n","\n","Q6. What was the sunspot seasonality?\n","\n","Ans. 11 or 22 years depending on whom do you ask.\n","\n","Q7. After studying this course, what neural network type do you think is best for predicting time series like our sunspots dataset?\n","\n","Ans. A Combination of all of the above.\n","\n","Q8. Why is MAE a good analytic for measuring accuracy of predictions for time series?\n","\n","Ans. It doesn't heavily punish large error like squared error do\n"]}]}
