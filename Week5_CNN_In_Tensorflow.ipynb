        "Sol. There was no point training after 2 epochs, as we overfit to the training data\n",

        "Q1. Why is the validation accuracy a better indicator of model performance than training accuracy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Sol. The validation accuracy is based on images that the model hasn't been trained with, and thus a better indicator of how the model will perform with new images.\n",

        "Q1. Why is overfitting more likely to occur on smaller datasets?\n",
        "\n",
        "Sol. Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process."
